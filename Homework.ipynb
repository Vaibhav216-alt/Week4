# Question 1
# Provide a definition of and example for each of these terms:

# | Term | Example | Definition |
# | ----- | ------- | ---------- |
# | int  | 10      | An integer is a whole number (without a fractional part). 
# | float | 3.14    | A floating-point number is a number that has a decimal point. 
# | string    | "Hello"  | A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. 
# | boolean    | True     | A boolean value represents either True or False. 
# | list | [1, 2, 3] | An ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. 
# | set    | {1, 2, 3} | An unordered collection of unique items. 
# | dictionary | {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} | A collection of key-value pairs.
